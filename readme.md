## My answers are not your answers
The input data you receive from the website is unique to your login. If you want to use my code to get the answer, you would still need to copy-paste your own input data into the relevant text file to get the correct solutions. Also please don't use my code to get your own answers. It defeats the whole purpose of the thing. Come on, be nice.
